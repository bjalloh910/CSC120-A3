- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The classmates I consult with while working on this assigment was Tahiya and Musa, we talked about how to create the canned messages and how to import random.
I attended TA hours on January 14 from 7-9pm.
My first impression on Java is that it seems very fun with all the different methods(Theres a lot) and very straight forward.
I notice that pyhton converts it's source code into machine code line by line and Java converts it into an intermediate code which is known as a bytecode. And python is much more slower while java is faster, but I think this just means java that it's going to be much more harder. I think a conclusion I can draw is that a lot of coding languages are similar when it comes to things such as the basics like writing varaibles, conditional statements, etc but things such as syntax will be very different and just the way you type out the code in general. 

Printing out the can of responses and allowing the user to pick any number of rounds they want worked. However, the mirror responses I struggled a lot. I was able to mirror the messages however, they wouldn't print on the same line for some reason.

The advice I'd give to someone taking this course in the future is to have some background knowledge before taking the class.
